This face recognition is based on deep learning in MATLAB using Viola-Jones algorithm with alexnet pre-trained model. This model compares 2 different faces to detect the names. We need to install alexnet and webcam connected to MATLAB

1) Create a new folder in a directory. Now run the ImageCollect code in the new folder directory which will take 150 images and save it in the folder. 
2) Create another folder in the original directory to act as database. Move the folder with the image data in this folder. 
3) Create another folder for second image to be collected. Repeat the same code in the second folder directory and send the folder to database folder.
4) Train the model and once 20 epochs are complete it is available to test and detect the face.
